# AWS dev hour v2

This is a copy of the tutorial at https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dev-hour-backend.git and https://pages.awscloud.com/global-traincert-twitch-dev-hour-building-modern-applications.html, only using CDK v2 instead of the deprecated v1 used in the original.

This version is written in Go. For v2 Typescript see https://github.com/mylesbennett/aws-dev-hour-backend-v2.

# Welcome to your CDK Go project!
